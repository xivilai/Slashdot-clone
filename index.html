                                From the SIGCSE paper: "Invocations of that [regret] clause have led to heart-to-heart

                                not-previously-reached demographic. But that same clause has also contributed to an
                                uptick in the number of cases referred to the university's honor council for
                                disciplinary action [which may result in required withdrawal from the university], in
                                part because we now feel more comfortable referring cases after students have had an
                                opportunity to take ownership themselves but have chosen not to do so." Bet you didn't

                            <div class="subhead">Rewound, the basic music player app released last week that you could
                                skin
                                to make your iPhone look remarkably like an iPod Classic, has been pulled from the App
                                Store, according to Rewound blog post published on Medium. The Verge reports:</div>
                            <p class="alt">
                                The blog says that Apple pulled the app because it copied the iPod's design, charged for
                                Apple Music features, and people could mistake the app for an Apple product. The blog
                                makes
                                the case that the app had a pretty basic interface that looked nothing like an Apple
                                app,
                                and the iPod classic skins didn't come preinstalled. (You had to download them after you
                                had
                                already installed the app.) We've asked Apple for comment, and we'll update this story
                                when
                                we hear back.

                                The Rewound blog says the iOS app can't be updated without "breaking the app for all
                                170,000+ users," but the developer, Louis Anslow, says he will attempt to bring the app
                                back
                                in some way. On a GoFundMe page for continued development of Rewound, Anslow says he
                                will
                                "try some tweaks to get Rewound resubmitted" on the App Store and that the GoFundMe will
                                help support development of a web app and an Android app.

                            <p>Microsoft said in a statement: "The ads within the app itself will be displayed
                                regardless of which email address you use it with. It is not removable, but you can

                                caused a domino effect, causing mass liquidations. PlusToken, a fraud scheme that

                                anonymous accounts, according to Chainalysis. The New York-based blockchain

                                have been actively selling bitcoin since June -- right after the cryptocurrency
                                established a year-to-date high of circa $14,000.

                            <p>According to Chainalysis, PlusToken had cashed out at least $185 million worth of bitcoin
                                via OTC desks. "We can say that those cashouts increased volatility in Bitcoin's price
                                and that they correlate significantly with Bitcoin price drops," says Chainalysis.
